# about-me

This is a webpage which gives the user information about me, including education, work experience, and my interests. There's also a nice photo of me.

The page opens prompting the user for their name, then asks a series of five yes or no questions which they must guess the asnwers to. The questions have unique alerts for each yes, no, or invalid response given by the user.
