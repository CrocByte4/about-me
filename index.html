        Hi there! I'm Joe and this is my about me page!
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a chilled out geek who loves PC gaming, working out at the gym and
        generally dossing around the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a long educational history, having gone through three colleges
        and a bunch of subject types, having earned a level 3 extended diploma
        in engineering with a Merit Merit Pass, and an access to higher
        education in science diploma. I attended The University of Sheffield for
        four years on a medical microbiology batchelors degree program, though I
        dropped out after struggling with my studies.

        My employment history is comparatively brief. I began working at a
        McDonalds in Sheffield in January of 2020 only for it to be put on hold
        in march when the first covid lockdown came in effect. After a brief
        return to it in October I left to focus on uni.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I can't say what the future may hold, I do plan on becoming a
        junior software developer, earning an open university degree and
        possibly emigrating to Australia. I've loved the country ever since I
        watched Steve Irwin's shenanigans as a kid.
